🚀 Overview
This repository contains the complete solution for Task 2 of the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Internship.
The objective is to analyze a social media ad campaign dataset and build an interactive dashboard revealing performance insights across:

I created two dashboards using:
✔ Google Looker Studio
✔ Tableau Public
Both dashboards highlight key KPIs, demographic breakdowns, trends, and campaign-level performance.
